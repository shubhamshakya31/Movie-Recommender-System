# Movie Recommender System

## Overview

The Movie Recommender System is designed to suggest movies based on user preferences by analyzing movie descriptions. Using Python and the NLTK library, this project applies Natural Language Processing techniques to recommend similar movies.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Processes raw movie data to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Provides insights and identifies patterns within the dataset.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Utilizes Porter Stemmer to normalize words, enhancing text analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Converts movie descriptions into numerical vectors using Count Vectorizer.
- **Recommendation Algorithm**: Employs Cosine Similarity to recommend movies based on their descriptions.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**: Clean and preprocess the movie dataset.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Transform movie descriptions into numerical format with Count Vectorizer.
3. **Recommendation**: Calculate cosine similarity between movie vectors to find and suggest similar movies.

## Requirements

- Python
- NLTK
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
