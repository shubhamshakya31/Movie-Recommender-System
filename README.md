# Movie-Recommender-System
This project is a Movie Recommender System designed to suggest movies to users based on their preferences. Built using Python and the NLTK library, the system leverages Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze movie descriptions and recommend similar movies.

#Key Features:
Data Cleaning: Processed raw movie data to ensure consistency and accuracy.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyzed data to gain insights and identify patterns.
Text Preprocessing: Applied Porter Stemmer to reduce words to their root forms, improving text analysis.
Vectorization: Utilized Count Vectorizer to convert text data into numerical format.
Similarity Calculation: Implemented Cosine Similarity to measure the similarity between movies based on their descriptions.
#How It Works:
Data Preparation: Clean and preprocess movie data.
Feature Extraction: Convert movie descriptions into numerical vectors using Count Vectorizer.
Recommendation Algorithm: Compute cosine similarity between movie vectors to find and recommend similar movies.
#Requirements:
Python
NLTK
Pandas
Scikit-learn
